# Labb_JavaWebServiceIntegration_SimpleHttpPlugin
A simple Http plugin written for a complete Http Server project mainly done by Hjalmar at https://github.com/vargen2/WebServer

The purpose of the lab project was to create a Java based Http server.
The main work was done by Hjalmar: https://github.com/vargen2
and the project got its repo at https://github.com/vargen2/WebServer
Other contributors to the lab project are Maksym and Bob.

The Http server uses Http request response objects with plugins developed in Java, Html, JavaScript and Css.
The plugins can easily be added to the web server since annotations and mapping to the plugins is used in the program.

this simple plugin will retrieve rows from an Sqlite3 database and return results as Html pages.
